## Summary
I am 26 years old and have been working
 in the healthcare field for three years.
About a year ago I started thinking about changing
my career. I have several developer friends who
advised me to start learning programming.

I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript on my own. 
And I'll tell you honestly - I liked it. Of course,
this is just the beginning and I still have a lot to learn.
But I am a diligent and responsible person,
I like to learn something new and increase my knowledge.
So I'm sure I can do it.
